# KingCobra {:snake: :arrow_right: :snail:} <br>
KingCobra is an open source client side single player game written in JavaScript along with HTML5 and CSS3. The game is in the beta development stage and looks forward for further improvements in functionality in order to stimulate the re-birth of the classical snake feeding game. The choice of the language makes it runnable on practically every computing device on Earth which comes along with a web browser.<br>
